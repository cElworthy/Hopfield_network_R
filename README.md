# Hopfield_network_R
This was made in 2019. 

Hopfield network is a basic neural network which I have used to 'learn' pixelated 'images'. Hopfield networks work upon the synaptic connections being symmetric i to j and j to i have the same weight. This allows us to make this simple model. Used here to 'store' images and find matching ones based on distortion of one or two pixels. The 'images' arent actually images at all but matrices of 1 and -1 which allow us to visualise the network 'learning'.
